Hola hola! I am originally from Ecuador and USA living in Melbourne, Australia since 2014. As a molecular epidemiologist with expertise in population genetics, epidemiology, and bioinformatics, I'm interested in combining these approaches to population-based studies of infectious diseases, particularly malaria. My current research aims to better understand malaria infection dynamics and host-parasite factors that contribute to sustaining malaria transmission in countries attempting elimination. I work closely with endemic country partners to support in-country capacity building and through my research I hope to contribute to enhance malaria surveillance, control and elimination strategies.

I completed my PhD at University of Melbourne in the laboratory of [Professor Karen Day](http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/day-group) and am currently a Joint Postdoctoral Scientist in the laboratories of [Professor Ivo Mueller](https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/ivo-mueller) and [Associate Professor Leanne Robinson](https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/leanne-robinson) at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. I also have ongoing appointments at the University of Melbourne and [Burnet Institute](https://www.burnet.edu.au/working_groups/49_vector_borne_diseases_and_tropical_public_health_group), am a member of the [Australian Centre for Research Excellence in Malaria Elimination](http://acreme.org.au) and the [Australian Centre for the Control and Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/australian-centre-control-tropical-diseases/1349119), and a researcher of the [Asia-Pacific International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/asia-pacific-icemr). 

Apart from my research, I am co-founder of the [The Artisan Project](https://theartisanprojectec.com), a social enterprise that works hand in hand with talented indigenous artisans in Ecuador. We use fashion as a tool to create income-generating opportunities and impulse social impact and innovation in Ecuador. I am also a co-organizer of [R-Ladies Melbourne](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-Melbourne/), a non-profit organization and local chapter of [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org) aiming to promote gender diversity in the R community, both in Australia and worldwide.

If you are interested in an Honors, Masters or PhD project I'm looking for an exceptional student to join an exciting project entitled ["Understanding malaria infection dynamics". See more details here](https://www.wehi.edu.au/student-research-project/understanding-malaria-infection-dynamics). If you are an international student, please get in touch if you are considering applying to the [Walter and Eliza Hall Institute International PhD Scholar Initiative](https://www.wehi.edu.au/education/phd/phd-application/international-phd-scholar-initiative).
