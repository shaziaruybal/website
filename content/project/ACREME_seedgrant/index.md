summary: This collaborative project aims to build the capacity for a novel genotyping tool for tracking malaria infections over space and time and quantifying clones within individual infections for improved malaria surveillance in the Asia-Pacific region. This tool is based on amplicon deep sequencing and will be optimized and validated on samples collected from Papua New Guinea and Myanmar. This tool can be used in a range of applications, including but not limited to, longitudinal studies, clinical efficacy trials, and to answer fundamental research questions about the biology of *Plasmodium* spp, such as discriminating recrudescence vs reinfection vs relapse.
