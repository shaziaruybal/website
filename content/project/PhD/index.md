summary: During my PhD I investigated the genetic epidemiology of the malaria parasite *Plasmodium falciparum* in Bongo District, Ghana in the laboratory of [Professor Karen Day](http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/day-group). I discovered that residents of all ages harbored infections that were genetically diverse and structured to ensure lifelong carriage of parasites. The findings from my PhD have supported the development of a novel malaria surveillance tool called the "*var* code" that can be applied to genetically fingerprint parasites based on variant antigen genes.

title: Genetic epidemiology of the *Plasmodium falciparum* reservoir of infection in Bongo District, Ghana

During my PhD I investigated the genetic epidemiology of the malaria parasite *Plasmodium falciparum* in Bongo District, Ghana and discovered that residents of all ages harbored infections that were genetically diverse and structured to ensure lifelong carriage of parasites. The findings from my PhD have supported the development of a novel malaria surveillance tool called the "*var* code" that can be applied to genetically fingerprint parasites based on variant antigen genes.    

In my current role, I apply my expertise to better understand malaria infection dynamics and host-parasite factors that contribute to sustaining malaria transmission despite intensified control efforts. I am actively involved in the design and implementation of field epidemiology studies and work closely with endemic country partners to support in-country capacity building and strengthen control and elimination efforts in the Asia-Pacific region.
