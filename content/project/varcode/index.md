summary: This collaborative project aims to understand the factors underlying *P. falciparum* resurgence in Ecuador after considerable progress towards elimination in previous years. By applying novel genetic tools, we aim to better understand malaria resurgence after an outbreak in Ecuador by investigating parasite microevolution and transmission dynamics to inform whether malaria cases in Ecuador are locally-acquired or imported from neighboring countries.
